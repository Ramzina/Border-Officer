# Setup

To make Border officer function in your server how you would expect, there are a couple things you need to do.

1) In systemconfig.py you will need to change "PUT YOUR TOKEN IN" to the token of your discord bot surrounded by speechmarks. (e.g TOKEN = "MTEyNDQ0MDAxNTgyNTU1MTUxMg.Gl93Y3.rm35IwIzH6Licy9UCUKL-JiHu6kfxH6rQeaRvM") This can be found on [Discord's developer portal.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2) Once you have run the bot with your token and it has started with no errors, you will need to run a couple setup commands. These commands include /logs, /welcome, /setupblacklist
Note these are important and a lot of the bots commands rely on them, yet you should only need to run them once.

3) You are all set! Have fun with Border officer and make sure to give him enough food to keep him working correctly :D
