# Border-Officer
This is code for my personal Discord bot, Border officer only used in a couple servers. The code is not the best but is still being worked on!

# [Requirements](https://github.com/Ramzina/Border-Officer/blob/main/requirements.txt)

Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ramzina/Border-Officer.git
```

Run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Setup

To make Border officer function in your server how you would expect, there are a couple things you need to do.

1) In main.py you will need to change the bot token to the token of your discord bot. This can be found on [Discord's developer portal.](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2) Once you have run the bot with your token and it has started with no errors, you will need to run a couple setup commands. These commands include /logs, /welcome, /setupblacklist
Note these are important and a lot of the bots commands rely on them, yet you should only need to run them once.

3) You are all set! Have fun with Border officer and make sure to give him enough food to keep him working correctly :D
